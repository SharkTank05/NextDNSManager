# About

NextDNS Manager is an Android application that simplifies the management of your [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration. NextDNS is a cloud-based DNS filter and firewall that protects your home, family, and privacy online. With NextDNS Manager, you can easily control your NextDNS settings and ensure a safer and more secure online experience.

NextDNS Manager can be installed on any Android phone or tablet running Android 12+.

**Note**: NextDNS Manager is a completely open-source project with no official ties to NextDNS.

# Features:

- **Configuration Management**: You can configure your NextDNS settings, including filtering modes, blocklists, and whitelists.

- **Real-time Statistics**: Get insights into your DNS queries, blocked requests, and security events in real-time.

- **Security and Privacy**: Enhance your online security and privacy by leveraging NextDNS' filtering capabilities.

- **Easy Installation**: You can download and install NextDNS Manager from the Google Play Store, F-Droid, or directly from the Github, providing multiple installation options.

# Installation

## Which installation method should I use?

It depends on your privacy preferences and how often you wish to recieve updates.

- If you are able to use Google Play, use it.
- If you're not able to use Google Play, sideloading an APK from this repository is your next best option.

For each build ("version") of the app, there are timelines for when the build will be available, so methods with longer timelines will result in longer wait times for updates.

|                  | Google Play   | Sideloaded APK | F-Droid       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Availability** | A few minutes | A few minutes  | Up to 14 days |

F-Droid takes much longer than any of the other methods because they have a human involved in the process, each app is signed by a human on a computer that is airgapped (not connected to the internet).
